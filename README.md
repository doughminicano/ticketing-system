<h1>Ticketing System</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my ticketing-system</h2>

<body>

  <h3>This was made as a small project for my IT interest and for some more React practice.</h3>

<h3>Before you get started:</h3>

<ul>
<li>This was made with Vite/React</li>
<li>The main files will be under the main branch </li>
</ul>
  <h3>Everything Used:</h3>
  <br />
<ul>
<li>tailwindcss
</li>
<li>framer motion
</li>
<li>react-dom
</li>
<li>axios (for fetching tickets/user from local database)
</li>
  <li>>json server</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Once you download repo, you are going to run yarn for your node modules with command:</h2>
<span>yarn or npm install</span>
<h2>2. Start your client side in ticket-system directory with command:</h2>
<span>yarn run or yarn dev</span>
<h2>3. Next start your json server under ticket-system/src/services with this command: </h2>
<span> npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000	</span>
<h4>4. Now everything should be running smoothly on your localhost</h4>
<p>The login page will appear first </p>
<span>Username = test@user.com</span>
